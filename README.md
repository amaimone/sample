# sample

Hello and welcome to my repository where I have a few samples of my work available for you to check out!

I have recently opted to shift career paths and dive deep into data analytics. The following documents you'll find here in this repository highlight some of the things I've learned during my journey this past year.

1. "Diamonds_Project_Presentation" is a video file of an analysis into the key factors that influence the price of a diamond. I take a deep look into the diamonds dataset and analyze and transform the data as well as perform linear regressions to accurately determine what the most important variables are. 

2. "King County Housing Project.Rmd" is my R code for another project where I take a look at the housing data provided by King County, Washington. In this report, I look at major variables to consider when purchasing a home and how those can affect the home's price. I compare two different models and use one to predict a home's price given specific parameters. "King County Housing Project - Report.pdf" is a written analysis report to supplement the R code. The data used, "kc_house_data_mod.csv", is also provided in this repository if you would like to run the code for yourself.

Thank you for checking out my work!
