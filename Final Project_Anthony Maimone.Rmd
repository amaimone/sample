# I modified the provided King County housing data with a supplemental data source that included the city each zip code corresponds to. I merged the two tables in using Power Query, which resulted in adding in another column for the city.

# feature engineering

# As mentioned above, I pulled additional data from the web that provided the city name that corresponds to each zipcode. I then merged that data table on the zipcode column using Power Query to add the city column to the dataset. I did this so that I could easily filter the dataset to only include Eastside homes. 

houses <- houses %>% mutate(city = as.character(city))

# filter to only include houses located in Eastside cities. 

east <- houses %>% filter(city == 'Bellevue' | city == 'Kirkland' | city == 'Redmond' | city == 'Woodinville' | city == 'Issaquah' | city == 'Newcastle' | city == 'Sammamish' | city == 'Bothell')

# create binary columns for city

city = model.matrix(~ city - 1, data = east)

east = cbind(east, city)

# remove city column since the dataset now has binary columsn for cities. Also removing other uneeded columns for model

east = select(east, -city, -id, -date, -lat, -long)

my_house_pred

#Given my desired inputs of a house in 4 bedroom 3 bath with 1800 square feet in Kirkland with grade and conditions of 8, the lasso model predicted the price would be $566,071.7. This is well below the average house price in Kirkland of $646,374.2 as identified earlier in this notebook. Ultimately the lasso model performed slightly better than the standard linear model at predicting home prices, however the error was still pretty large.
